Fingers crossed this works. If so, hello world! This is Selim and this is my website. I made this website because I had a lot of thoughts about my career path, my career goals, and my path to clinical research in general. Somebody at the NIH held a very cool meeting last week showing us how to do this while I was away at a conference, and I told myself I would make it after the MCAT. So, now that I took it last week, here it is!

I'm not sure what the theme of this site is going to be, but I think it would be a good place for me to organize my thoughts, focus on my research interests, and just generally engage with research in my own space. I'm really excited to have the platform to do this!

Just generally, here are some of my research interests: Neurodegenerative disorders, GABA transporters, Representational similarity analysis, Endocrine disorders, and machine learning. 

Obviously these are just what I am currently excited to research, and as I learn more my research interests will change. 

Not sure what else I can say at this point, so I'm going to end it here. Let's see where this goes!
